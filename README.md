# Typus: Admin Panel for Ruby on Rails applications

**Typus** is a control panel for [Ruby on Rails][rails] applications to allow
trusted users edit structured content.

Itâ€™s not a CMS with a full working system but it provides a part of the
system: authentication, permissions and basic look and feel for your
websites control panel. So using [Rails][rails] with **Typus** lets you
concentrate on your application instead of the bits to manage the system.

**Typus** is the "old latin" word for **type** which stands for:

> A category of people or things having common characteristics.

You can try a demo [here][typus_demo].
